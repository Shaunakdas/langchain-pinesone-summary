# LangChain Pinecone Summary

A sample Streamlit web application for document summarization with LangChain and Pinecone.

## Introduction

LangChain is an open-source framework designed to facilitate the development of applications that leverage the power of large language models (LLMs). It offers a wide range of capabilities, including chatbots, text summarization, data generation, code understanding, question answering, evaluation, and more.

Pinecone is a fully managed vector database that simplifies the creation of high-performance vector search applications. It provides an infrastructure-free solution for storing, managing, and searching vector embeddings. By combining LangChain with Pinecone, you can harness the power of LLMs and enable semantic search, recommendations, and other information retrieval use cases.
